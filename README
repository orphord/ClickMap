This is the server for the ClickMap project.  The idea is that users will send
location information indicating something is happening at a given location
which can be app defined, this server will record each notification with the
app name, coordinates, and time of click.  See the example below.

One version using the ClickMap might be a phone app where people are clicking if
they see a person they find attractive.  A user could create an account
indicating the gender they find attractive and some user name, then clicks would
transmit location info (from the phone), application name, and user name.  Time
would be recorded on the server side.  Clicks are stored and might be displayed
as a heat map to premium users (or some such).
